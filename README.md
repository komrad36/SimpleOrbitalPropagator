# SimpleOrbitalPropagator
Super super simple MATLAB orbital propagator in just a few lines. Experiment with orbits!

Set an initial position and velocity, and maybe an integrator tolerance and timespan
if you wish, and off you go! I've written more than enough propagators in a slew of
languages, some better than others. This is a simple example and a good reminder
that with modern tools even orbital mechanics can be explored by the curious with
relative ease. It's not out of reach to shoot for the stars.

Check out the screenshot or try it in MATLAB or Octave!
